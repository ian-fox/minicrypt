# MiniCrypt

MiniCrypt is a personal interest project which aims to generate cryptic crosswords in a bite-sized form factor, like the [miniature crosswords](https://www.nytimes.com/crosswords/game/mini) of the New York Times.

I will be blogging about its development at [ianfox.dev](https://ianfox.dev).
